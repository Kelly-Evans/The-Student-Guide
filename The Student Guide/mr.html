                        <p><h2>Deadpool (2016)</h2>
                        <p>With everything from emotional storylines, to action filled storylines, Deadpool has you covered! The story is based upon Marvel Comics’ Wade Wilson and his alter-ego, Deadpool, whilst we follow him on his journey to hunt down the man who ran evil experiments on him and changed his life forever.
                        <br>
                        As somebody who has not followed the comics before, I found it a little hard to adjust at first and actually understand the storyline and the humour, but after a while, it started to make sense, and it actually felt like we were a part of Wade’s emotions. Director Tim Miller did such a great job getting the audience to be so enthralled into the story. It was really interesting to watch the start of the film and then to be re-joined at the same point later after grasping the story. The only thing that I felt let the film down, was the constant ‘yo-yoing’ of emotion and action. In some ways, this worked, but in others it seemed a little confusing to follow. One minute his tactics caused explosive results and you are enthralled in the action, but then it gets cut to a quiet scene for too long, followed by head action. But the yo-yoing of action and emotion is how Deadpool’s life really is so that could work on two factors.
                        <p>Overall, I loved the film! I really hope that there is a sequel to it. To say that I have not read the comics before, I did get into the film and enjoy it. So go check it out!

                        <p><h2>Keith Lemon:The Film (2012)</h2>
                        <p>The Film, is a true Yorkshire gem, and Keith Lemon (Leigh Francis) has done a great job in this film, but the bit that gets to me the most is that the film just proves the ‘North - South Divide, between Yorkshire and London, when Keith visits London trying to plug his invention and it doesn’t particularly work. It really is a silly film but it works, and it works better than some of these serious movies out there.
                        <br>
                        This film has so many bad reviews out there, but it is definitely in my top five! Perhaps with Leigh Francis being from Yorkshire, it is more Yorkshire kind of humour? Either way, I loved it! Definitely worth a see.

                        <h2>The Inbetweeners (2008-2014)</h2>
                        <p>I have been watching The Inbetweeners lately, the full series and the movies. Series 1 begins with Will, a ‘posh’ boy who’s mum is unable to afford to keep him in private school, and instead, introduces him to public school, and the story is based around him trying to fit in with the other students, but he sticks out like a sore thumb. But the rest of the series’ follows his life with the friends that he does make during their lives in school.
                        <br>
                        The movies are a little different to the series though. There is more of a story to them. The series is mostly stereotypical into what teenage boys get up to in school and in their free time, but the movies show them in a different environment as they are abroad. Their behaviour on holiday is still stereotypical of them but I just feel like these work better than the series. The second movie is also my favourite; it shows the boys after school and into university as they’ve grown older, which I like because it isn’t cheap trying to keep them in school for a story they try to continue the series. It follows Jay on his gap year in Australia and how ‘the lads’ go and join him, and they get up to lots of mis-adventures. It shows emotion and comedy at the same time. Definitely worth a watch!
