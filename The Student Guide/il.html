                        <p>You want to be an independent learner but you do not know where to start? You're in luck, because you are in the right place! All you have to do is to follow these easy steps!</p>

                        </a>

                        <h3>What is the meaning of "independent learning"?</h3>
                        <p>Independent learning is when you are able to learn, think and do research on your own, without expecting support from anyone else. Here are some tips:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <h3>You have to be flexible</h3> 
                            <li>You want to be successful in your studies, but you also have to work to earn some money to support yourself and your education. What you have to do? Organise your time and responsibilities with a timetable. It always helps!</li>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Manage your time</h3>
                            <li>This is another important thing to do - manage your time. It is important to know how to balance between university work, independent learning, and your social life. Time management is really important. If you are good at it, you will soon find that the time you have is enough for everything.</li>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Motivation</h3> 
                            <li>This is not just "Dude, you can do it!". Motivation is when you really want to do something, know how to do it and strongly believe that you are completely able to do it. We all know that to be motivated all the time takes a toll. So, that's why I recommend you to create your own Motivation poster. Before you say something like "C'mon, that's so stupid! I'm not gonna do that!" think about it! Every morning when you open your eyes or when you are halfway towards giving up, just take a look at it and remember why you started. You can stick photos or write some motivational quotes such as "Never give up!" or "Before you think of giving up, remember why you started".</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h3>Is it important or necessary to be an independent learner?</h3>

                            <li>No one said that it is important or necessary. But to be honest, you will gain only useful skills that you can use later in life (e.g in your job). Strong reading and writing skills, organisation, multi-tasking, and time management etc are all examples of the skills you will develop on your way to becoming an independent learner.</li>

                            <h3>Reading, reading, reading!</h3> 
                            <li>Books aren't so bad! They are our friends! Of course, if you know how to use them. It's not necessary to be a boring book. It can be any kind of book. From fantasy to romance. We live in a world where you can find a lot of interesting books for free. Just use you your local library or the internet. It's pretty easy! Reading will help you to improve your reading speed. And one more thing; pay attention to the words! It's important to know their meaning and how to properly use them in a conversation.</li>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Sources</h3> 
                            <li>It's important to learn how to use different sources in your research. It improves your knowledge and research skills. When you need help, there's no shame in asking someone!</li>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Be patient</h3>
                            <li>Becoming an independent learner takes time. You have to be persistent and wait for the final result. Nothing beautiful comes easy! Make your own aims and try to find way to reach them. You see, it's pretty easy! We wish you good luck with your independent studies!</li>
