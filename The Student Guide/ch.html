                    <br>
                    A lot of students are unaware of the health risks they can impose on themselves whilst at the computer. By reading through this guide and following these simple steps, you should hopefully be more aware of how to make sure staying up all night won’t affect your health for the worse!
                    <br>
                    <h2>Step 1 - Your Monitor</h2>
                    <center><img src="img/Image1.jpg" alt="Monitor Safety"></center>
                    <p>Your monitor is essential to making sure your eyesight isn’t strained. By positioning your monitor correctly you can make sure your eyes aren’t strained and fatigued. Always try to position your monitor so that there is no or minimal glare and reflections on the screen and remember suitable room lighting is important! Following these steps can also improve your posture.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Step 2 - Your Chair</h2>
                    <center><img src="img/Image2.jpg" alt="Chair Safety"></center>
                    <p>You should be sat on a chair which is easily adjustable. Adjusting your height from the highest to lowest ensures that you find the sweet spot so your legs are comfortable and not compressed, usually at 90 degrees or higher. Usually to keep your posture from being affected, the recommended angle is actually slightly greater than 90 degrees. This makes sure your limbs and back are at a slightly more opened angle, relieving any strain! Don’t forget that moving into different positions every now and again ensures better circulation and reduces muscle fatigue.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Step 3 - Lighting</h2>
                    <center><img src="img/Image3.jpg" alt="Lighting Safety"></center>
                    <p>Getting the lighting right is just as important as previous steps. If set incorrectly, the lighting in the room could affect your eyes (eyestrain, dry eyes, itch/irritated eyes). Indirect lighting is the best lighting. Usually overhead lights which are usually standard in each room is the way to go. It provides the best ‘even illumination’. This ambient lighting should be quite low as well as bright lighting can strain your eyes even more, tiring them out. The other most important thing to remember about lighting is glare from the sun. This is usually combated by positioning the monitor so it isn’t affected or by getting blinds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Step 4 - Keyboard and Mouse</h2>
                    <center><img src="img/Image4.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Mouse Safety"></center>
                    <p>Your hands are on the keyboard and mouse most of the time. Using it incorrectly can also have an impact on your hands and wrists. There can be a number of ailments which can come from using these incorrectly which include sore wrists and in extreme cases carpal tunnel. To avoid these make sure that when you are typing on your keyboard to have it in the proper position. This is usually just above your lap. Using the keyboard in position will enable your arms to have an open angle which reduces strain. As for your mouse it would be pretty hard to use it wrong, the only thing you can do is take a break every now and again to give your wrists a break.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Step 5 - Breaks</h2>
                    <center><img src="img/Image5.jpg" alt="Breaks Safety"></center>
                    <p>Finally, taking breaks is just as important as any of the tips suggested. The standard break times is 5-10 mins every 50-60 mins continuous screen and keyboard/mouse usage. Ensuring that you are taking breaks properly and have the correct setup, you should be fine! By following some, if not all, of these tips then you further decrease the risk of damaging yourself or getting tired and cranky.</p>
