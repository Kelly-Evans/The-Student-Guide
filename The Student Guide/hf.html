                        <h3>Workout Summary</h3>
                        <p>This student guide will help you to improve your skills and get in the best shape of your life!
                        <p>First of all, I hope that you don't have plans for tomorrow because that's when your sports journey begins! 
                        <p>All you will need is a bottle of water, light cloths, some good workout music in your headphones and a motivated mind (we will talk about this later). Before starting to train you need to realize that your diet must be managed correctly and your meals have a fixed time.
                        <br>
                        <h3>How to stay motivated</h3>
                        <p>Many people want to change something in their life, but they do not have the motivation required to do so. I met many people that were really disappointed about their lifestyle and they asked me: "How can I start doing sport?". The answer is easy: You need to forget about your old habbits and be able to comepletely change your life!
                        <p>First of all, I recommend people to guide their actions after this quote: "When you want to succeed as much as you want to breathe, then you'll be successful". Considering this, people that are looking to change their lifestyle must pay more attention to details like: "Should I go to the party and get drunk or stay home and rest?" "Should I eat some junk food from KFC or go home and cook something heatlhy by myself?" And so on the list continues.
                        <p>Once you start making changed is your life it is all about making decisions and choosing what is good and what is not. Nobody said that it is easy, because if it was easy, everybody would have done it!
                        <p>Last but not least, one of the most significant things in your evolution is to be better than your old verion, to be better than you were yesterday, but not to be better than somebody else. If you compare yourself with someone who have started to work earlier than you, it's obvious that you are not as good as that person, but if you just focus on your own evolution and your own improvement, then you will be satisfied and "Once you see the progress, it becomes and addiction"
                        <br>
                        <h3>What to eat</h3>
                        <p>If you just want to be healthy, but not at a high level, you do not need to be very careful with your meals, but don't even think about junk food, coke, alcohol and so on. 
                        <p>On the first hand, a healthy lifestyle is a balanced way of eating, which means that you need to eat  a large variety of food, from fruits to sea food, vegetables and  meat. Another important aspect is to hidratate. Even if it seems apparently easy and not so essential, drinking at least 2 liters of water per day is one of the main points of staying healthy. 
                        <p>Don't forget do have a fixed schedule when it comes to meals, because if you can not eat at the same hous ( that should be 7:00-9:00 Breakfast, 13:00-15:00 Lunch, 18:00-20:00 Dinner) then you are wasting your time trying to achieve your goal. 
                        <p>Scientists discovered that taking your main macronutrients after your workout seems to be more efficient to muscle grow or losing body fat, depending on goals. Yes, it is obviously that after a hard training, the body needs more nutrients than generally, when people do their routine, without making that much effort. Even so, some people tend to make their own meal programs because we are all different and what applies to some of us may not be applied to other and so on. Anyways, even if you prefer to train in the morning or late in the night after you finish your work, it's essential to eat as a result of your effort.
                        <br>
                        <h3>How to eat regarding your goal</h3>
                        <em><strong><br>Cutting/Shredding period - Summer
                        <br>Bulking period – Winter</strong></em>
                        <p>Those two are the most significant diets for bodybuilders. You need to understand that in order to gain muscle mass, you need to gain weight which means fat as well. It’s simply impossible to gain just muscles without fat. This is the main reason for which there exists “shredding” which defines as the process of losing weight, but most of this weight consists of bod fat. Reducing the body fat percentage is the main key of getting the dream body. There are many methods of treating both diets.  Some bodybuilders prefer longer bulking periods in which they gain up to 15 kilograms of muscle mass and body fat, but after they cut, the result is unbelievable. The only concern is that such a transformation would need more than a year of bulking. 
                        <p>You have to keep in mind that even the workout routine differs in those two periods. For example, shredding is more about killing the muscle with more reps and intense sets of exercises and on the other hand, bulking it’s about low intensification workouts with fewer reps per set of exercises. The central idea of bulking workout is to focus on each muscle and define every single part of your body.
                        <p>When it comes to differences, diets don’t range very much so the following example applies for both kinds of periods (shredding and bulking).
                        <blockquote><strong>Breakfast:  250g oats, 50g peanut butter, 1 banana/150g blueberries, 25g Whey Protein/2 Whole Eggs
                        <p>Lunch: 400g integral pasta, 200g Tuna in Water/3-6Scrambled eggs and 100g Bacon/Beef Soup
                        <p>Dinner: 250 Chicken Breast, 300g White Rice/220g Salmon, 200g Frozen Vegetables/250g Beef etc.
                        <p>Snacks: You can always supply with protein shakes, but fruits are also very important when you feel like eating some junk food (snacks, chips, chocolate etc)</strong></blockquote>
                        
                        <p><em>This is just an example of foods per day, so treat it fairly because there a lot of other options that can be taken into consideration!</em>
